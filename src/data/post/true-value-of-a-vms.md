## The advantages of our VMS versus a building's lobby visitor registration system "VRS".

- **Customisation**: A lobby visitor registration system can only offer a standardised lobby solution for all tenants in the building. A company-specific VMS can be tailored for your company's specific workflows, branding, and visitor requirements.

- **Visitor Experience**: A lobby VRS can be generalised and potentially impersonal. Companies using New Wave Workspace VMS can personalise welcome messages, customise the check-in experience for their visitors, and pre-register faster, and enable a VIP-like welcome to their visitors. 

- **Security & Compliance**: A lobby VRS is limited to building-wide policies and protocols, while a company-specific VMS has the ability to enforce company-specific security policies (NDA signing, ID verification, white-lists) and compliance with internal regulations. 

- **Data Ownership & Control**: Data is managed by building administration, potentially less control over data security under a lobby VRS. Company-specific VMS offers full control over visitor data, enabling the company to manage, store, and secure it according to internal policies and regulations. 

- **Visitor Pre-screening**: A lobby VRS doesn't offer pre-screening; visitors typically register upon arrival. A VMS solution has the ability to pre-screen visitors (criminal background, vaccination status, etc.) before arrival, improving security and safety.

- **Integration with Internal Systems**: VRS are usually isolated, not integrated with tenant systems. A company-specific VMS can offer seamless integration with internal systems (calendars, CRMs, access control), improving efficiency and coordination. 

- **Analytics & Reporting**: A lobby VRS usually provides basic reports, often shared accross tenants. A VMS can offer detailed visitor analytics (frequency, visitor type, visit purpose) and custom reporting tailored to your needs. 

- **Emergency Evacuation**: Evacuation lists cover all building visitors, and may not differentiate by tenant in a lobby VRS. A VMS offers company-specific emergency evacuation lists and notifications to ensure all visitors and employees are accounted for.

- **Branding & Professionalism**: Typically, a VRS offers no branding; visitors encounter a generic building branding. VMS offers fully branded interface (logos, messages, kiosks, hands-free pre-registration) to enhance the company's image and make a strong first impression. 

- **Multi-location Management**: VRS are limited to single location. A VMS can offer a centralised VMS across multiple offices, locations, providing consistent visitor management across all company sites.

- **Access Control**: Visitors are generally restricted to specific areas as dictated by the building administrators under a VRS. Company-specific VMS can be fine-tuned to offer visitors access to certain areas, meeting rooms, or sensitive company zones based on individual profiles.

- **Visitor Notifications**: VRS are usually limited to delayed notifications when a visitor arrives. VMS offers instant notifications (e-mail, Microsoft Teams, SMS, Slack) to one or many employees when visitors arrive, enhancing communication and readiness.

- **Language & Localisation**: VRS may not offer support to multiple languages or localised preferences. VMS is fully localised with more than 11 languages, based on visitor preferences. 

- **Visitor Feedback & Follow-up**:  VRS don't offer to collect visitor feedback or track post-visit interactions. New Wave Workspace VMS enables post-visit feedback, surveys, and tracking of follow-up actions, improving visitor satisfaction and business outcomes.

- **Cost Efficiency**: VRS are usually included into building services, potentially at a low direct cost to companies. VMS have a greater long-term ROI through improved efficiency, productivity, and enhanced visitor relationships tailored to the company's needs.
