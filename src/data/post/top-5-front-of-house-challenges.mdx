Front-of-House (FoH) teams in large corporations are the unsung heroes of workplace operations. They handle far more than simply greeting visitors; they orchestrate the VIP experience, manage bookings, coordinate services, and ensure executives, clients, and departments are looked after with precision. For organizations that want to deliver a seamless, white-glove service to their VIP customers and internal stakeholders, the challenges are significant.

At New Wave Workspace, we’ve built our Bookings Management module specifically to empower Front-of-House teams with the tools they need to overcome these hurdles. Let’s explore the top five challenges FoH teams face — and how our platform helps solve them.

## 1. Coordinating Complex VIP Requests

VIPs and executives often require tailored meeting arrangements — from last-minute room changes to catering preferences and specialized services. Keeping track of these moving parts manually leads to errors and missed details.

**How New Wave Helps**

Our Bookings Management module centralizes all requests in one platform. Receptionists can see every VIP booking, preference, and service requirement in real time, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

## 2. Managing Limited Room Availability

In large organizations, meeting rooms are a premium resource. Without visibility and control, double-bookings or unused spaces frustrate both employees and guests.

**How New Wave Helps**

Receptionists gain a live, visual view of room availability, enabling them to allocate the right spaces quickly. Smart rules prevent conflicts, and proactive alerts highlight underutilized rooms that can be reassigned.

## 3. Communicating Across Departments

From facilities and catering to IT and security, FoH teams must coordinate with multiple departments to deliver a flawless experience. Miscommunication can result in delays or poor service.

**How New Wave Helps**

Our platform enables real-time updates and notifications for all stakeholders. When a booking changes, everyone — from catering to AV support — is instantly informed, reducing misalignment and confusion.

## 4. Delivering White-Glove Service at Scale

While personalized attention is expected, scaling that level of service across thousands of employees and visitors is challenging. Receptionists often juggle too many requests at once.

**How New Wave Helps**

With customizable workflows, receptionists can automate repetitive tasks while still personalizing VIP experiences. For example, the system can flag VIP guests, attach notes on preferences, and remind staff of required services — ensuring consistent, high-touch delivery.

## 5. Maintaining a Professional, Stress-Free First Impression

The front desk is the first point of contact for clients and visitors. If the reception area feels disorganized or overwhelmed, it negatively impacts corporate reputation.

**How New Wave Helps**

By giving receptionists a streamlined platform that organizes bookings, services, and communication, our solution frees up their time to focus on what matters most: welcoming guests warmly and creating a professional first impression.

## Extending the Experience: Meeting Room Panels, Global Catering, and Automatic Conflict Resolution

Modern FoH operations don’t stop at one meeting room or one building. Global corporations must manage multiple rooms, across multiple regions and time zones, each with their own requirements. New Wave Workspace Bookings Management makes this possible.

### Crestron Meeting Room Panels

Through our partnership with Crestron, New Wave integrates seamlessly with world-class meeting room scheduling panels. This gives employees and visitors real-time visibility into room availability right at the door. If a room is free, it can be booked instantly from the panel. If a VIP has pre-booked it, the system locks the schedule to avoid conflicts. Together, New Wave and Crestron ensure that the digital experience is as smooth as the in-person one.

### Time Zone and Catering Complexity Made Simple

Consider this: a global executive team is running back-to-back meetings across São Paulo, London, and Singapore. Breakfast needs to be served in São Paulo, lunch in London, and supper in Singapore — all tied to the same board meeting agenda.

With New Wave, catering orders are attached directly to room bookings, with local service providers notified automatically. FoH teams in each region see only the requests relevant to them, ensuring cultural, culinary, and time-zone differences are handled with ease.

### The Planner: Wizard for Conflict-Free Resource Scheduling

At the heart of New Wave’s solution lies the Planner, a powerful wizard that automatically detects and resolves resource conflicts. Whether it’s two departments vying for the same room, or catering staff stretched across multiple events, the Planner suggests alternative spaces, times, or service providers — giving receptionists and planners control without the chaos.

## Elevating Front-of-House Operations with New Wave Workspace

Large corporations rely on their Front-of-House teams to deliver much more than hospitality — they deliver brand experience. The New Wave Workspace Bookings Management module is purpose-built to support FoH teams with coordination, visibility, and control, ensuring every booking is handled with accuracy, efficiency, and care.

With the added power of Crestron room panels, multi-region catering management, and the Planner wizard for conflict resolution, New Wave extends beyond booking rooms — it orchestrates the entire global workplace experience.
