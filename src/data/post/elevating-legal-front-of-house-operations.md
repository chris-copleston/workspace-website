For front-of-house teams in law firms, the challenge is balancing client hospitality, internal coordination, and operational efficiency. That’s where New Wave Workspace steps in - a single, integrated platform that transforms how legal reception and facilities teams orchestrate the entire client meeting experience.

## One Platform, All Services, Zero Friction

Unlike generic room booking tools or catering add-ons, New Wave Workspace was built as an all-in-one digital workspace platform. For a law firm’s front-of-house, this means:

* **Meeting Room Scheduling** – Book the right room in seconds, with live availability, visual floorplans, and recurring meeting options.
* **Catering Services** – Request coffee, lunch, or special hospitality directly within the booking workflow - automatically routed to your catering team.
* **Visitor Management** – Pre-register guests, print badges, capture NDAs, and notify hosts the moment clients arrive.
* **Service Coordination** – Add AV setup, room layout changes, or extra chairs without juggling multiple systems.
* **Instant Updates** – Real-time changes instantly notify catering, facilities, and security - no more phone tag or missed requests.

## Room Scheduling at the Door - Powered by Crestron

New Wave Workspace partners with Crestron, the market leader in best-in-class room scheduling panels, to bring booking right to the meeting room door.

For legal front-of-house teams, this means:

* **At-a-glance room status** – Instantly see if a room is free, in use, or about to be occupied.
* **On-the-spot booking** – Reserve the room directly from the Crestron panel without returning to a desk.
* **Live sync with New Wave Workspace** – Every change on the panel is instantly reflected across catering, AV, and visitor workflows.
* **Elegant, professional hardware** – A premium look that fits the high standards of modern law firms.
* **Client confidence** – Guests see technology that matches the professionalism of your legal brand.

This integration ensures there’s no guesswork, no double-booking, and no last-minute scrambling. The front-of-house team has the same visibility as meeting hosts and service teams, keeping operations tight and client impressions flawless.

## Why This Matters for Law Firms

### 1. A Flawless Client Experience

Clients expect precision, privacy, and professionalism. New Wave ensures their arrival is smooth, their meeting room is ready, and refreshments are on time - every time.

### 2. Full Control for Front-of-House Teams

Reception and facilities staff get a single dashboard showing all meetings, visitors, and service requests. No switching between catering spreadsheets, visitor logs, and booking systems.

### 3. Integration with Legal Workflows

Many law firms rely on Outlook or Google Calendar - New Wave syncs seamlessly, so bookings made in your usual calendar still connect to catering and visitor management workflows.

### 4. Reducing Admin Overload

No more emailing catering, calling IT for AV, or chasing meeting changes. One update in New Wave automatically alerts all service teams.

### 5. Data for Continuous Improvement

Track how often rooms are used, which catering items are most popular, and when visitor flow peaks - valuable insights for cost control and service quality.

## The New Wave Difference: Designed for Enterprise, Perfect for Legal

While other platforms might handle a piece of the puzzle - a catering module here, a visitor app there - New Wave Workspace gives law firms a unified front-of-house solution.

### Key differentiators:

* All-in-one booking + catering + visitor platform (no multiple vendors)
* Crestron hardware integration for world-class in-room scheduling
* Customizable workflows for legal privacy and compliance needs
* Enterprise-grade security for sensitive client data
* Scalable - from boutique firms to multi-location global practices
* Real-time service coordination across catering, AV, facilities, and security

## Final Word: Making Every Client Visit Count

For law firms, every client interaction is a moment to reinforce confidence and credibility. New Wave Workspace equips front-of-house teams with the tools they need to deliver an impeccable experience - from first handshake to last coffee refill.

When the details matter (and in law, they always do), you need a platform that keeps them all under control. That’s why more and more law firm front-of-house leaders are choosing New Wave Workspace.
