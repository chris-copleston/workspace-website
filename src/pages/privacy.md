need to accept cookies, as we can only provide you with certain personalised features of this Service by
using them.
Our cookies don’t store sensitive information such as your name, address: they simply hold the ‘key’ that,

delete cookies from our website, or any other website, you can use your browser to do this. Each browser
is different, so check the ‘Help’ menu of your web browser to learn how to change your cookie

### 5. What is a cookie and how to manage them
A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser and stored by the browser. The
information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This
enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
We use session cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you
close your browser. We will use the session cookies for the following purposes: To prevent accidental
contact form resubmissions and to save user search preferences to improve the user experience.

Each browser is different, so check the ‘Help’ menu of your web browser to learn how to change your
cookie preferences. For example, in Microsoft Edge you can refuse all cookies by clicking Tools, Internet
Options, Privacy and selecting Block all cookies using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies will,
however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites and Apps.

### 6. Inquiries

information submitted the Service via a "contact us" form or other similar inquiry method may receive a
response.

### 7. GDPR

European Union (EU) since May 2018. The GDPR enhances EU individuals’ privacy rights and places
significantly obligations on organizations handling data.

storage and transfer or use. The GDPR gives data subjects more rights and control over their data by
regulating how we should handle and store any personal data they collect.

and how it is processed.
- Right of rectification: Where reasonably possible, data subjects will be entitled to have personal
data rectified/edited if they feel that it is inaccurate or incomplete.
- Right to erasure: This is also sometimes referred to as ‘the right to be forgotten’, data subjects
have the right to have their personal data permanently deleted upon their request and they do not
have to provide a reason for the request.
- Right to restrict processing: Data subjects have the right to block processing of their personal
data.
- Right to data portability: Where reasonably possible, data subjects have the right to retain and
reuse their personal data for their own purpose.
- Right to object: In certain circumstances, data subjects are entitled to object to their personal
