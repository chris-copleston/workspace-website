## Intelligent Meeting Room Scheduling

Simplify meeting planning with our Scheduling Assistant that aligns organisers', attendees' and Office 365 meeting room calendar availability into one intuitive view. It’s smart, fast, and effortless.

Say goodbye to no-shows, double bookings and scheduling chaos - with our workspace platform and your workplace policies.

## Desk Booking

In today’s modern work environment, finding the right desk is key to making the office a destination rather than a chore. Our platform empowers employees to search for workspaces tailored to their unique preferences—from height-adjustable desks, dual monitors, and dedicated docking stations to accessible setups, window views, and even specific proximities to points-of-interest. With robust resource tagging and customisable search, employees can quickly locate the ideal spot that supports both their productivity and comfort.

For employers, the benefits go even further. Our solution provides valuable insights into employee search preferences and workspace demands, highlighting which features and amenities are most sought-after and where availability may fall short. This actionable intelligence enables you to strategically enhance your office offerings, boost employee satisfaction, and create a truly attractive, modern workplace that keeps your team engaged and motivated.

## Smart Locker Booking

In today’s hybrid work environment, employees need secure, convenient access to personal storage and efficient mailroom services that simplify their day. A smart locker solution, integrated with New Wave Workspace, lets employees easily reserve lockers for their belongings with access to enhanced mailroom services to ensure packages and mail are safely delivered and ready for pickup when they come into the office.

For employers, this integrated approach not only boosts employee satisfaction by providing practical, secure storage options but also improves operational efficiency and office security. With real-time insights into locker utilisation and mailroom demand, you can optimise resources, tailor services to evolving needs, and transform your workplace into a modern, secure, and attractive destination for your team.

For employers, the platform provides real-time insights into parking demand and usage, enabling informed decisions to enhance facility management and boost overall efficiency. By streamlining parking operations, you can reduce congestion, improve the commuting experience and ensure available spots are used optimally.

## Flexible Workplace Policies

Your workspace platform should adapt to your needs, not the other way around. With over 50 configurable policies—such as in-office booking limits, restricted zones, max booking lead times, no-show auto-cancellations, early check-ins, and booking extension limits—New Wave Workspace has you covered. Need something unique? We can tailor rules to your needs and apply them intelligently at any step in the booking workflow.
