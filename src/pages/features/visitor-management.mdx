## Visitor Management System Workflow
1.	**Effortless Invitations**
    - Hosts can invite visitors through an intuitive interface by simply entering their details. Invitations include all relevant information such as meeting time, location, directions, and security requirements, delivered via email or SMS.
2.	**Seamless Check-In Experience**
    - Upon arrival, visitors enjoy a frictionless, receptionist-less check-in process. Using a self-service kiosk, QR code, or pre-sent digital pass, they confirm their identity and complete any required forms. This ensures a swift, hassle-free start to their visit.
3.	**Real-Time Notifications**
    - Hosts are instantly notified when visitors check in. Additional stakeholders, such as security personnel or meeting co-hosts, can also be alerted, ensuring the visitor is guided and attended to promptly.
4.	**Customizable Workflows for Security**
    - For highly secure sites, customizable workflows ensure compliance with stringent requirements. Capture critical information like identification, NDAs, or health declarations while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere.
5.	**Engaging Visitor Journey**
    - Throughout their visit, visitors can receive targeted messages, from warm greetings to on-site directions or post-visit thank-you notes, enhancing their overall experience.
6.	**Emergency and Departure Management**
    - In emergencies, the system supports quick headcounts and instant communication with visitors for safety protocols. When visitors leave, the check-out process ensures accurate tracking of their time on-site.

_The Result: A polished, efficient, and secure visitor experience that combines hospitality with robust functionality, tailored to the needs of any organization._
