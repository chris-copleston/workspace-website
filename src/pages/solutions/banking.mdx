## Challenges Facing Retail Banking in Today's Market

The financial services industry, especially retail banking, is facing a unique set of challenges. Established banks are managing the transition to hybrid work environments and return-to-office mandates similar to Fortune 1000 companies. Meanwhile, they are also navigating a competitive landscape with new online banking players that are redefining customer experiences. Additionally, many banks have made substantial investments in their physical branches, but those investments are underutilized. There is a pressing need to bring customers back to the branch, turning these spaces into engagement hubs that differentiate the bank from digital-first competitors.
