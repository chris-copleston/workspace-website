## Challenges in Higher Education

Higher education institutions face unique challenges as they navigate a global landscape impacted by shifting immigration laws, reduced revenue, and the evolving needs of staff, faculty, and students. Universities are experiencing sharp declines in international student enrolment, which directly affects their revenue streams. Additionally, campuses are under pressure to maximize their real estate assets and efficiently utilize idle academic and non-academic spaces.

Further compounding the issue, many universities continue to rely on manual and disconnected processes. This inefficiency creates operational challenges and increases costs. To stay competitive and relevant, universities must evolve digitally by transforming administrative tasks, streamlining workflows, and creating new revenue-generation opportunities.
