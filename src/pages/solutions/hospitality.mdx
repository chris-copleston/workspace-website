## The Problem: Inefficient Meeting Room Booking Process

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, hotels with meeting rooms often miss out on potential business due to a manual, slow booking process. When a customer shows interest in booking a meeting room, they often encounter a time lag where they search, find, and then wait for a clerk to reach out to finalize the booking. This delayed response can lead to missed opportunities as potential clients move on to other venues with faster, more seamless booking experiences. Hotels struggle to monetize meeting rooms effectively and maintain a steady flow of bookings due to this inefficiency.

## How New Wave Workspace Can Help: Streamlining and Automating the Process

With New Wave, hotels can create a public-facing platform where external users can easily search for meeting rooms based on their requirements, such as room size, projector availability, seating configurations, and catering services.

The time to see a return on investment (ROI) with New Wave Workspace will vary based on factors such as the size of the hotel, the number of meeting rooms, and the volume of bookings. However, hotels can typically expect:

- **Short-Term (3-6 months)**: Initial benefits such as improved booking efficiency, better customer satisfaction, and increased revenue from the enhanced user experience.
- **Medium-Term (6-12 months)**: Ongoing optimization of room configurations based on analytics, leading to a steady increase in revenue and a more predictable flow of bookings.
